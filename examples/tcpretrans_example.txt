Demonstrations of tcpretrans, the Linux ftrace version.


Tracing TCP retransmits on a busy server:

Ending tracing...

This shows TCP retransmits by dynamically tracing the kernel function that does
the retransmit. This is a low overhead approach.

The PID may or may not make sense: it's showing the PID that was on-CPU,
however, retransmits are often timer-based, where it's the kernel that is
on-CPU.

The STATE column shows the TCP state for the socket performing the retransmit.
The "--" column is the packet type. "R>" for retransmit.


Use -h to print the USAGE message:

# ./tcpretrans -h
USAGE: tcpretrans [-h]
   eg,
       tcpretrans        	 # trace TCP retransmits
